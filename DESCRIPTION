Description: Implementation of the Log Periodic Power Law Singularity (LPPLS) 
    model for detecting and analyzing financial bubbles. The package provides 
    functions for model estimation, confidence indicator calculation, and 
    visualization of results. Based on the theoretical framework developed by 
    Johansen, Ledoit, and Sornette for identifying critical points in financial 
    time series that may precede market crashes. Supports multiple optimization
    algorithms including MLSL, Differential Evolution, and hybrid approaches.
